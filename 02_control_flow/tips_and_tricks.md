# Python Control Flow Tips & Tricks

## Conditional Statements Best Practices

- Use `elif` instead of multiple `if` statements for mutually exclusive conditions.
- Consider using `match-case` for complex conditional logic (Python 3.10+).
- Use parentheses for complex boolean expressions to improve readability.
- Avoid deep nesting by using early returns or guard clauses.

## Loop Optimization Tips

- Use `for` loops when you know the number of iterations.
- Use `while` loops for conditions that may change during execution.
- Prefer `enumerate()` over `range(len())` when you need both index and value.
- Use `zip()` to iterate over multiple sequences simultaneously.

## Loop Control Best Practices

- Use `break` to exit loops early when a condition is met.
- Use `continue` to skip the current iteration and move to the next.
- Use `pass` as a placeholder for incomplete code blocks.
- Avoid using `else` with loops unless you understand its behavior.

## Performance Tips

- List comprehensions are usually faster than equivalent for loops.
- Use generator expressions for memory-efficient iteration over large datasets.
- Consider using `all()` and `any()` for checking conditions across sequences.
- Use `in` operator for membership testing instead of manual loops.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't modify a list while iterating over it (use a copy or iterate backwards).
- Be careful with mutable default arguments in functions.
- Remember that `while True:` creates an infinite loop - always have a break condition.
- Use proper indentation - Python is indentation-sensitive.

## Debugging Tips

- Use `print()` statements to debug loop iterations and conditional branches.
- Use debugger tools like `pdb` for step-by-step execution.
- Test edge cases like empty lists, single-element lists, and boundary conditions.
- Use meaningful variable names in loop counters and conditions.
